Description: Tools for forecasting semi-regular seasonal epidemic curves and
    similar time series. Includes an empirical Bayes approach that forms a prior
    by transforming historical curves, a basis regression approach that balances
    matching observations from the current season and matching historical
    seasons' measurements for future weeks, and timestep-by-timestep weighted
    kernel density estimation on backward differences parameterized by both the
    time series measurements and the current time.
